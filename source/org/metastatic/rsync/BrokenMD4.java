/**
 * <p>An implementation of Ron Rivest's MD4 message digest algorithm.
 * MD4 was the precursor to the stronger MD5
 * algorithm, and while not considered cryptograpically secure itself,
 * MD4 is in use in various applications. It is slightly faster than
 * MD5.</p>
 *
 * <p>This implementation is provided for compatibility with the "MD4"
 * implementation in the C version of rsync -- which differs in that the
 * input is NOT padded when the input is divisible by 64, and that only
 * the lower 32 bits of the length is used in the padding (the real MD4
 * always pads the input and uses the entire 8 bytes in the padding).
 *
 * <p><strong>DO NOT USE THIS IMPLEMENTATION IN NEW
 * PROGRAMS.</strong></p>
